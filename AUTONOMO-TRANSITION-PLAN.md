# Rick and Morty Project: Portfolio and Contingency Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the Rick and Morty project setup primarily as a portfolio piece to showcase to potential employers, with legal contingency plans in case of continued unemployment after the autónomo period.

## Primary Purpose: Portfolio for Job Search

The Rick and Morty project serves as:
- A portfolio piece to demonstrate your development skills to potential employers
- A showcase of your technical capabilities in Next.js, TypeScript, and related technologies
- A demonstration of your ability to create and maintain a full-stack application
- A concrete example of your work to discuss during interviews

## Funding Strategy

- You will pay for domain and hosting for the first year regardless
- This ensures the site is deployed and accessible for potential employers to view
- The project will be funded personally as a professional portfolio investment
- This approach eliminates any potential issues with unemployment benefit regulations

## Autónomo Period (First 9 Months): Optional Features

During your 9-month autónomo period with compatibilización:
- You can optionally operate the Rick and Morty project with donations (since there are no restrictions)
- However, since you're personally funding it anyway, donations are not necessary
- The project remains primarily a portfolio piece during this time

## Contingency Plan: Continued Unemployment

If you remain unemployed after the autónomo period, you want to ensure the project can continue legally:

### Key Requirements for Unemployment Period

1. **No Habitual Income (Habitualidad de Ingresos)**: Avoid creating a regular income pattern
2. **No Profit Motive (Ánimo de Lucro)**: Maintain the non-profit nature of the project
3. **Self-Funding**: Continue personal funding to avoid donation-related complications
4. **Portfolio Focus**: Maintain the project as a portfolio piece rather than income source

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. During Autónomo Period (Months 1-9)
- Maintain the project as a portfolio piece
- Optionally keep donation functionality (though not necessary since you're self-funding)
- Use the project to showcase skills to potential employers
- Keep all transparency and compliance measures in place

#### 2. Contingency Preparation
- Prepare code that can comment out donation functionality if needed
- Calculate costs for continued self-funding if unemployment continues
- Maintain all compliance documentation

#### 3. Post-Autónomo Period (After Month 9) - If Needed
- If still unemployed, ensure donation functionality is disabled
- Continue self-funding the domain and hosting costs personally
- Maintain the project as a portfolio/non-profit resource
- Keep all compliance measures in place

### Recommended Approach

Since you're funding the project personally anyway, the simplest approach is:
1. Keep the project as a self-funded portfolio piece throughout
2. Optionally comment out donation functionality to eliminate any potential issues
3. Maintain all compliance measures as portfolio documentation
4. Use the project actively in your job search efforts

### Important Considerations

#### 1. SEPE Communication
- Inform SEPE about your autónomo registration and the compatibilización if you pursue monetized projects
- The Rick and Morty project, as a self-funded portfolio piece, should not affect unemployment benefits

#### 2. Portfolio Benefits
- The project demonstrates your technical skills to potential employers
- Open source nature shows collaboration and community engagement
- Compliance measures demonstrate attention to legal requirements
- Shows ability to maintain a production application
- Working on this project is part of your job search efforts, not against them
- The project serves as a concrete example of your work to discuss during interviews
- Demonstrates initiative, technical skills, and commitment to professional development

#### 3. Record Keeping
- Maintain records of personal expenses for the project (for portfolio documentation)
- Document the non-profit nature of the project
- Keep all compliance measures in place

## Implementation Timeline

#### Phase 1: Portfolio Development (Ongoing)
- Complete the Rick and Morty project as a showcase of your skills
- Ensure all compliance measures are in place
- Deploy the site and make it accessible
- Use the project actively in job search efforts

#### Phase 2: Job Search Period (During Autónomo Period)
- Continue using the project as a portfolio piece for interviews
- Optionally keep donation functionality (though not necessary)
- Maintain the project's professional appearance

#### Phase 3: Contingency (If Unemployment Continues After Autónomo Period)
- If needed, ensure donation functionality is disabled
- Continue self-funding the project as a portfolio investment
- Maintain all compliance measures

## Conclusion

Your approach is well-structured: the Rick and Morty project primarily serves as a professional portfolio piece to showcase to potential employers. Since you're funding it personally for the first year regardless, the project functions as a portfolio investment rather than an income source. This approach eliminates potential complications with unemployment benefit regulations while providing you with a high-quality portfolio piece to advance your career as a developer.

The legal compliance measures you've implemented demonstrate professionalism and attention to regulatory requirements, which could be valuable talking points during interviews.
