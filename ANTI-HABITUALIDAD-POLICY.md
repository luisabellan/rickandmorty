# Anti-Habitual Income Policy

## Purpose
This policy ensures our Rick and Morty Fan Site remains compliant with Spanish unemployment benefits (prestación contributiva de desempleo) regulations by preventing any regular income pattern (habitualidad de ingresos).

## Key Measures

1. **No Subscription Model**: We do not offer any subscription services or recurring donations that would create a regular income pattern.

2. **Donation Limits**: 
   - No individual donor may contribute more than €50 per month
   - Annual donation limit per donor is €200
   - These limits prevent the appearance of a service being provided in exchange for payment

3. **Irregular Donation Schedule**: 
   - Donations are completely voluntary and on-demand
   - No schedule or reminders are sent to users for donations
   - The donation option is not prominently featured on the site

4. **Non-Commercial Purpose**:
   - The site remains free to access for all users
   - No premium accounts or paid features are offered
   - All content remains freely available regardless of donation status

5. **Transparency**:
   - Clear communication that donations are only for covering hosting costs
   - Regular publication of expense reports showing how donations are used

## Implementation

1. The donation system will track individual donation amounts and frequencies
2. Automated systems will flag accounts that approach donation limits
3. The site will clearly state that donations are not required for access to content
4. No benefits or special access are granted based on donation amounts

This approach ensures that donations remain occasional and voluntary, without creating any expectation of ongoing payments from users.
