# Avoiding Cuota de Autónomos for the Rick and Morty Project

## Overview

This document outlines the measures to ensure the Rick and Morty project does not require registering as self-employed (autónomo) or paying cuota de autónomos, while maintaining compatibility with Spanish unemployment benefits (prestación contributiva de desempleo).

## Key Requirements to Avoid Self-Employment Status

### 1. Occasional vs. Habitual Activity
- The activity must be occasional, not regular or continuous
- Avoid creating a pattern of regular income
- Don't operate the project as a business with the intention of making a profit

### 2. No Ánimo de Lucro (No Profit Motive)
- All donations must be used exclusively for project expenses (hosting, domain)
- Document that no personal profit is made from the activity
- Clearly communicate that donations are for covering costs only

### 3. Time Commitment
- Don't dedicate full-time or near full-time effort to the project
- Maintain it as a side activity that doesn't interfere with seeking employment
- Don't abandon job search efforts due to this activity

### 4. Income Level
- Keep income below levels that would suggest a primary occupation
- Income should be clearly supplemental and occasional

## Specific Measures to Maintain Compliance

### 1. Document Everything
- Keep detailed records showing donations are used only for project expenses
- Maintain financial records that demonstrate no personal profit
- Document that this is a non-commercial fan project

### 2. Limit Activity Frequency
- Avoid regular posting schedules that might suggest a business operation
- Don't actively solicit donations regularly
- Don't market the project as a service

### 3. Maintain Unemployment Status
- Continue to demonstrate active job search efforts
- Don't register as self-employed (autónomo)
- Continue attending required appointments with employment services

### 4. Donation Platform Configuration
- Use Ko-fi as configured to avoid recurring payments
- Don't offer subscriptions or recurring donations
- Set donation tiers that reflect actual costs rather than profit goals

### 5. Legal Documentation
- Have clear policies about the non-profit nature of the project
- Publish financial transparency reports
- Maintain open-source licensing (MIT) to show community ownership

## Administrative Steps

### 1. SEPE Communication
- Inform SEPE about the occasional income-generating activity
- Seek confirmation that the activity is compatible with unemployment benefits
- Follow any specific reporting requirements they provide

### 2. Professional Consultation
- Consult with a tax advisor familiar with Spanish unemployment regulations
- Get written confirmation about the project's compatibility with unemployment status
- Understand reporting obligations to maintain compliance

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Regular monthly income that could be considered a salary
- Full-time dedication to the project
- Marketing or promotional activities that suggest a business
- Offering services in exchange for payments
- Registering as self-employed (autónomo)
- Creating a business structure or company for the project

## Compliance Monitoring

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly: Review donation patterns to ensure they remain occasional
- Quarterly: Update financial transparency reports
- Annually: Review overall compliance with unemployment benefit requirements

### Documentation Requirements
- Maintain all donation records from Ko-fi
- Document all expenses related to the project
- Keep records of communications with SEPE
- Preserve all financial transparency reports

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Configure Ko-fi to avoid recurring payments
- [ ] Set clear donation purposes (hosting and domain expenses only)
- [ ] Create financial transparency system
- [ ] Document non-profit nature of the project
- [ ] Inform SEPE about the activity
- [ ] Establish record-keeping system
- [ ] Set up financial reporting
- [ ] Create policies about the non-commercial nature of the project
- [ ] Continue job search efforts

## Legal Framework

The Spanish legislation governing this includes:
- Workers' Statute (Estatuto de los Trabajadores)
- General Social Security Law (Ley General de la Seguridad Social)
- Regulations on the Special Scheme for Self-Employed Workers (RETA)

According to these regulations, the key factors in determining whether someone must register as self-employed include:
- The habitual nature of the activity
- Whether the activity is carried out in an organized manner
- Whether the activity is performed for profit
- The level of dedication and economic dependence on the activity

## Conclusion

By following these measures, you can maintain the Rick and Morty project as an occasional, non-profit fan resource that doesn't require registering as self-employed or paying cuota de autónomos. The key is ensuring the activity remains clearly occasional and non-commercial in nature while maintaining all proper documentation and reporting requirements.
