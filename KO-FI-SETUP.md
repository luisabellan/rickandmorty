# Using Ko-fi for Rick and Morty Project Donations

## Why Ko-fi is Appropriate for Our Project

Ko-fi has been selected as our donation platform because it aligns well with our requirements for maintaining compatibility with Spanish unemployment benefits (prestaci√≥n contributiva de desempleo):

1. **No Recurring Payments by Default**: Ko-fi is designed for one-time donations rather than subscriptions, which helps avoid creating "habitual income" patterns that could affect unemployment benefits.

2. **Clear Purpose**: The platform is explicitly designed for supporting creators and projects, making it clear that donations are voluntary.

3. **Transparent Reporting**: Ko-fi provides clear records of all donations, which is important for compliance with SEPE and AEAT reporting requirements.

4. **Low Commercial Profile**: Ko-fi is less commercial than some other payment processors, which supports the non-profit nature of our project.

## Setting Up Ko-fi with a Spanish Bank Account

Yes, you can link a Spanish bank account to Ko-fi. Here's the process:

1. **Create a Ko-fi Account**: Sign up at ko-fi.com
2. **Bank Account Linking**: In your Ko-fi dashboard, connect your Spanish bank account for receiving donations
3. **Verification**: Verify your identity and bank account details as required
4. **Payouts**: Ko-fi processes donations to your linked bank account (fees apply)

## Important Compliance Considerations

### 1. Tax and SEPE Reporting
- Even though donations go to a personal bank account, you may need to report this income to SEPE depending on amounts and frequency
- Include Ko-fi donations in your monthly income reporting to SEPE if required
- Report any income from Ko-fi in your annual tax declaration if it exceeds certain thresholds

### 2. Documentation Requirements
- Keep detailed records of all donations received via Ko-fi
- Document how donations are used exclusively for hosting and domain expenses
- Maintain all transaction records from Ko-fi for audit purposes

### 3. Communication Strategy
- Clearly state on your Ko-fi page that donations are used exclusively for hosting and domain expenses
- Maintain the non-profit nature of the project in all communications
- Avoid any language suggesting commercial services or products

### 4. Donation Management
- Consider setting up your Ko-fi to encourage smaller, occasional donations rather than large amounts
- Monitor donation frequency to ensure it remains occasional rather than habitual
- Set appropriate donation tiers that reflect the actual costs of the project
